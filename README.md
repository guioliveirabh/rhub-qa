# Test Automation


Welcome to the RHUB Automation

To run the tests:

Navigate to the test folder desired, all the tests are using behave
so it's to easy to start then

You can choose run one by one (behave test_name.feature) or just 
type behave at the console into the features folder.
This action will be understood by the system as that you want to run
alll the tests.feature in that folder
